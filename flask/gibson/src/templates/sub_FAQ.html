                        <li>If you require warranty service in the U.S., please contact our Consumer Service team at 1-800-444-2766. You may also contact your nearest authorized warranty service center, for service center locations please contact Consumer Service at 1-800-444-2766 . Please note! For purchases made outside of the U.S., please contact your authorized Gibson distributor or local dealer for warranty service information. The owner will be responsible for getting the instrument to the Warranty Center. If the instrument is shipped, freight and insurance must be prepaid. If there is no Warranty Center in your area, you may contact your nearest authorized Gibson dealer. Your dealer will evaluate the situation, then contact us for further instructions. All returns to Gibson must have a return authorization. Any shipments that do not have authorization cannot be accepted. Only authorized Gibson service centers may perform warranty service - any service performed by unauthorized persons will void your warranty. Gibson disclaims liability for defects or damages caused by service performed by unauthorized persons and all non-warranty service not performed by an authorized Gibson service center.

If non-warranty work is recommended, a quotation will be issued and must be approved by the owner before such work is done. We appreciate a prompt notification of your wishes. It is not necessary to purchase non-warranty work in order to obtain service on materials covered by the warranty. Subsequent to inspecting an instrument upon arrival, Gibson or the authorized Gibson Warranty Repair Center will advise you or your dealer of the approximate date of completion. The repaired instrument or part will be returned to the owner or dealer, freight collect and insured.

                        <li>This is known as “finish checking.” This is a result of the instrument being subjected to a rapid change in temperature or humidity. In most cases it happens in winter when a chilled instrument is exposed to warm air. The cracks are a result of the wood expanding faster than the lacquer. Since we have no control over the environmental conditions surrounding the use of the instrument, unfortunately we cannot cover this type of situation under our warranty.</li>

                        <li>Stand damage occurs when the chemicals in the rubber used on many guitar stands reacts with the nitrocellulose lacquer used to finish our instruments. It can range from a slight discoloration to the finish, to actual "eating away" of the lacquer topcoat. Unfortunately, this situation is not covered under warranty. The safest way to prevent this from happening is to cover the rubber parts of your stand with a soft cotton cloth (we recommend using guitar polishing cloths). Guitar stands should only be used to “temporarily” store your instrument, such as at a gig. The safest place to store your instrument is in its case. Please also note that many clip-on tuners may also damage nitrocellulose lacquer.</li>

                        <li>The tarnish on hardware occurs due to a reaction between the plating and moisture, either in the air or from perspiration. Keep in mind that all hardware will tarnish eventually - it is not a sign that your hardware is "cheap." In some areas there is low moisture content (humidity) in the air so the tarnishing process will be slower, but it will eventually happen. You can slow down the tarnishing process by wiping down the instrument every time you play it. This one step will add life to the hardware and slow down the tarnishing process. Also, make sure you store the instrument in its case to help protect it from exposure to high humidity levels in the air.</li>

                        <li>In our constant effort to stand by our consumers, protect them, and bring them the finest products in the world, Gibson takes a firm and aggressive stance against all makers of counterfeit guitars and their distribution channels. If you suspect a guitar advertised on a non-Gibson website is counterfeit you can use our [counterfeit reporting form](https://www.gibson.com/Support/Report-Counterfeits "counterfeit reporting form") to submit the URL along with your comments for our team to review. If a guitar is being sold for a fraction of what it would typically sell for, it is likely not a real Gibson guitar. The best way for consumers to protect themselves against fraud is to purchase your Gibson guitar from an authorized dealer. You can also contact our  Consumer Service team at 1-800-444-2766 for any inquiries or advice. We strongly urge all consumers to be careful and aware of this worldwide issue.
