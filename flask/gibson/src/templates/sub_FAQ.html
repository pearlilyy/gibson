                        <li>If you require warranty service in the U.S., please contact our Consumer Service team at
                            1-800-444-2766. You may also contact your nearest authorized warranty service center, for
                            service center locations please contact Consumer Service at 1-800-444-2766 . Please
                            note! For purchases made outside of the U.S., please contact your authorized Gibson
                            distributor or local dealer for warranty service information. The owner will be responsible
                            for getting the instrument to the Warranty Center. If the instrument is shipped, freight and
                            insurance must be prepaid. If there is no Warranty Center in your area, you may contact your
                            nearest authorized Gibson dealer. Your dealer will evaluate the situation, then contact us
                            for further instructions. All returns to Gibson must have a return authorization. Any
                            shipments that do not have authorization cannot be accepted. Only authorized Gibson service
                            centers may perform warranty service - any service performed by unauthorized persons will
                            void your warranty. Gibson disclaims liability for defects or damages caused by service
                            performed by unauthorized persons and all non-warranty service not performed by an
                            authorized Gibson service center. When contacting Gibson in writing you should include a
                            complete description of the problem. If non-warranty work is recommended, a quotation will
                            be issued and must be approved by the owner before such work is done. We appreciate a prompt
                            notification of your wishes. It is not necessary to purchase non-warranty work in order to
                            obtain service on materials covered by the warranty. Subsequent to inspecting an instrument
                            upon arrival, Gibson or the authorized Gibson Warranty Repair Center will advise you or your
                            dealer of the approximate date of completion. The repaired instrument or part will be
                            returned to the owner or dealer, freight collect and insured. No representative or other
                            person is authorized to assume for Gibson any liability except as stated above. For further

                        <li>This is known as “finish checking.” This is a result of the instrument being subjected to a
                            rapid change in temperature or humidity. In most cases it happens in winter when a chilled
                            instrument is exposed to warm air. The cracks are a result of the wood expanding faster than
                            the lacquer. Since we have no control over the environmental conditions surrounding the use
                            of the instrument, unfortunately we cannot cover this type of situation under our warranty.

                        <li>Stand damage occurs when the chemicals in the rubber used on many guitar stands reacts with
                            the nitrocellulose lacquer used to finish our instruments. It can range from a slight
                            discoloration to the finish, to actual "eating away" of the lacquer topcoat. Unfortunately,
                            this situation is not covered under warranty. The safest way to prevent this from happening
                            is to cover the rubber parts of your stand with a soft cotton cloth (we recommend using
                            guitar polishing cloths). Guitar stands should only be used to “temporarily” store your
                            instrument, such as at a gig. The safest place to store your instrument is in its case.
                            Please also note that many clip-on tuners may also damage nitrocellulose lacquer.</li>

                        <li>The tarnish on hardware occurs due to a reaction between the plating and moisture, either in
                            the air or from perspiration. Keep in mind that all hardware will tarnish eventually - it is
                            not a sign that your hardware is "cheap." In some areas there is low moisture content
                            (humidity) in the air so the tarnishing process will be slower, but it will eventually
                            happen. You can slow down the tarnishing process by wiping down the instrument every time
                            you play it. This one step will add life to the hardware and slow down the tarnishing
                            process. Also, make sure you store the instrument in its case to help protect it from
                            exposure to high humidity levels in the air.</li>

                        <li>In our constant effort to stand by our consumers, protect them, and bring them the finest
                            products in the world, Gibson takes a firm and aggressive stance against all makers of
                            counterfeit guitars and their distribution channels. If you suspect a guitar advertised on a
                            non-Gibson website is counterfeit you can use our [counterfeit
                            reporting form](https://www.gibson.com/Support/Report-Counterfeits "counterfeit
                            reporting form") to submit the URL along with your comments for our team to review. If a
                            guitar is being sold for a fraction of what it would typically sell for, it is likely not a
                            real Gibson guitar. The best way for consumers to protect themselves against fraud is to
                            purchase your Gibson guitar from an authorized dealer. You can also contact our  Consumer
                            Service team at 1-800-444-2766 for any inquiries or advice. We strongly urge all consumers
