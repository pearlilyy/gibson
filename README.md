# gibson Guitar Renewal Website

## Welcome to my Gibson Website Renewal Project!

- *Objective:* Making a User-friendly website with a lighter and more fun mode
- *Theme:* Making people enjoy the website and adding fun stuff such as music history, videos, musicians, and learning how to play guitar

- *What I did* In this project,
1. I designed and created all the banners, Images, and most of the logos.
2. Put unique functions that the original site doesn't have: guitar rental service & Musician stories who loved Gibson.
3. Built up all the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files.
4. Connected the templates to the practical functions: login, logout, password hashing, and register functions.

- *Difficulty*
1. Password decoding; I was able to hash and save the password with Hashlib, but had trouble in decoding.

- *Solutions*
1. Instead of Hashlib and using one-side hashing, I used the same Bcrypt function to encode and decode the password.
